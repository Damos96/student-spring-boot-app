<!-- 
Thymeleaf templates are just HTML with some additional element attributes that guide a
template in rendering request data. For example, if there were a request attribute whose key is
"message" , and you wanted it to be rendered into an HTML <p> tag by Thymeleaf, youâ€™d write
the following in your Thymeleaf template:
	
	<p th:text="${message}">placeholder message</p>

When the template is rendered into HTML, the body of the <p> element will be replaced with the
value of the servlet request attribute whose key is "message" . The th:text attribute is a
Thymeleaf-namespaced attribute that performs the replacement. 

The ${} operator tells it to use the value of a request attribute ( "message" , in this case).

<link rel="stylesheet" th:href="@{/styles.css}" />
